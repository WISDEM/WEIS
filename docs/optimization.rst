Optimization in WEIS
====================

WEIS is platform for multidisciplinary analysis and optimization (MDAO),
based on the OpenMDAO toolset. WEIS leverages the `optimization
capabilities of
OpenMDAO <https://openmdao.org/newdocs/versions/latest/features/building_blocks/drivers/index.html>`_
and `extensions in
WISDEM <https://wisdem.readthedocs.io/en/master/inputs/analysis_schema.html#driver>`_
to perform multidisciplinary and multifidelity wind turbine analyses
including controls.

Key
~~~

*Scope:* does the method solve a local or global problem?

*Derivatives:* does the method use derivatives for optimization

*Convergent:* does the method have a convergence proof for its scope

*Constraints:* constraints that can be used with the method

   - equality constraints: ``=``
   - inequality constraints: ``<``
   - compatibility with linear constraints only: ``(L)``
   - compatibility with nonlinear constraints: ``(NL)``

Optimization case study: IEA22
==============================

In ``WEIS/examples/17_IEA22_Optimization``, we have an optimization
example which can be used to design the semisubmersible platform for the
IEA 22 280m reference wind turbine. We will concentrate on the files
``analysis_options_raft_ptfm_opt.yaml`` and
``modeling_options_raft.yaml``, which specify the platform design study.

The study sets design variables:
   - ``floating.joints``
      - ``z_coordinate[main_keel, col1_keel, col2_keel, col3_keel]``
      - ``r_coordinate[main_keel, col1_keel, col2_keel, col3_keel]``
      - not sure exactly what these do, but presumably they set cylindrical coordinates of the truss system members (less an angle?)
   - ``floating.members``
      - ``groups["column1, column2, column3]:diameter``
      - presumably this is setting the diameters of the truss system members?

and constraints:
   - ``floating.survival_heel``: upper bound
      - maximum pitching heel allowable in parked conditions
   - ``floating.metacentric_height``: lower bound
      - “Ensures hydrostatic stability with a positive metacentric height”
      - distance between center of gravity of a marine vessel and its metacenter (point between vessel-fixed vertical line through C.o.G. and inertial-frame-fixed line through center of buoyancy)
      - dictates static stability in the small-heel angle limit (i.e. characterizes stability)
   - ``floating.pitch_period``: upper & lower bound
      - period of the pitching motion (bow (stern) up vs. down rotation about center of mass)
   - ``floating.heave_period``: upper & lower bound
      - period of the heave (linear vertical motion of a marine vessel)
   - ``floating.fixed_ballast_capacity``: on
      - “Ensures that there is sufficient volume to hold the specified fixed (permanent) ballast”
   - ``floating.variable_ballast_capacity``: on
      - “Ensures that there is sufficient volume to hold the needed water (variable) ballast to achieve neutral buoyancy”
   - ``floating.freeboard_margin``: on
      - “Ensures that the freeboard (top points of structure) of floating platform stays above the waterline at the survival heel offset”
      - the deck surface should not be submerged in the worst-case conditions
   - ``floating.draft_margin``: on
      - “keep draft from raising above water line during survival_heel, largest wave”
      - the bottom of the hull should not rise above the water surface in the worst-case conditions
   - ``floating.fairlead_depth``: on
      - “keep the fairlead above bottom trough of largest wave”
      - don’t dunk the fairlead in worst-case conditions
   - ``control.Max_PtfmPitch``: max
      - “Maximum platform pitch displacement over all cases. Can be computed in both RAFT and OpenFAST. The higher fidelity option will be used when active.”
   - ``control.Std_PtfmPitch``: max
      - “Maximum platform pitch standard deviation over all cases. Can be computed in both RAFT and OpenFAST. The higher fidelity option will be used when active.”
   - ``control.nacelle_acceleration``: max
      - “Maximum Nacelle IMU accelleration magnitude, i.e., sqrt(NcIMUTAxs^2 + NcIMUTAys^2 + NcIMUTAzs^2). Can be computed in both RAFT and OpenFAST. The higher fidelity option will be used when active.”

with a merit figure of the structural mass
   - ``structural_mass`` (``floatingse.system_structural_mass``)
