=========================
Design Load Cases in WEIS
=========================

Design load cases (DLCs) specify the conditions that a turbine must operate in safely thorughout its lifetime.
These load cases are defined in IEC standards.
We supplement the standards with information from the DTU design load basis (cite).

--------------------------
How to Set Up DLCs in WEIS
--------------------------

DLCs are configured in the modeling options (link). 
A full set of input information is contained within the modeling schema.
An example (a subset of a modeling input) is shown next::

  DLC_driver:
    metocean_conditions:
        wind_speed: [1.,3.,5.,7.,9.,11.,13.,15.,17.,19.,21.,23.,25.,27.,29.]
        wave_height_NSS: [0.84,0.84,0.87,0.99,1.15,1.34,1.58,1.82,2.08,2.34,2.66,2.98,3.28,3.77,3.94]
        wave_period_NSS: [8.3,8.3,8.3,7.7,7.1,6.3,6.1,6.2,6.2,6.7,7.1,7.1,7.7,7.7,7.7]
        wave_height_fatigue: [0.84,0.84,0.87,0.99,1.15,1.34,1.58,1.82,2.08,2.34,2.66,2.98,3.28,3.77,3.94]
        wave_period_fatigue: [8.3,8.3,8.3,7.7,7.1,6.3,6.1,6.2,6.2,6.7,7.1,7.1,7.7,7.7,7.7]
        wave_height_SSS: [9.7,9.7,9.7,9.7,9.7,9.7,9.7,9.7,9.7,9.7,9.7,9.7,9.7,9.7,9.7]
        wave_period_SSS: [13.6,13.6,13.6,13.6,13.6,13.6,13.6,13.6,13.6,13.6,13.6,13.6,13.6,13.6,13.6]
        wave_height1: 5.9
        wave_period1: 11.2
        wave_height50: 9.7
        wave_period50: 13.6
    DLCs: # Currently supported IEC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 5.1, 6.1, 6.3, or define a Custom one
        - DLC: "1.1"
          ws_bin_size: 5
          n_seeds: 2
          #  analysis_time: 5.
          #  transient_time: 5.
          #  wind_speed: [3., 5., 7., 9., 11., 13., 15., 17., 19., 21., 23., 25.]
          turbulent_wind:
              HubHt: 110
              GridHeight: 160
              GridWidth: 160

The ``metocean_conditions`` are defined using tables of ``wind_speed``, ``wave_height``, and ``wave_period`` for normal sea states (``NSS``) and severe sea states (``SSS``), and sea states representative of 1- and 50-year return periods.
Individual DLCs use these conditions to determine specific sea conditions for each case, but they can also be overwritten in each case.

Users can specify the wind speed bin size (``ws_bin_size``) or the specific wind speeds (``wind_speed``).
The number of seeds (``n_seed``) and specifics about the turbsim inputs (link?, ``turbulent_wind``) can also be specified.
``transient_time`` is excluded from timeseries analysis; only ``analysis_time`` is used.
A complete listing of the DLC options can be found here `DLC options`_ below.

Reviewing DLC Cases
-------------------

The DLC Case Matrix
-------------------

WEIS creates a case matrix for each DLC; this case matrix, is located in the same directory as the openfast runs in both yaml and txt format.
The case matrix specifies which inputs are changed for each case.
An example case matrix is shown next::

   Case_ID  AeroDyn15      AeroDyn15       ElastoDyn  ElastoDyn  ElastoDyn  ElastoDyn  ElastoDyn  Fst    Fst    HydroDyn  HydroDyn  HydroDyn  InflowWind   TurbSim

This case matrix represents DLC 6.1 and shows the initial conditions (BlPitch*, RotSpeed) as well as the sea state (WaveHs, WaveTp) and wind condtions (HWindSpeed, RandSeed1) for each case.

Expected DLC Outputs in OpenFAST

.. For each:
.. Short description.
.. Defaults?
.. Timeseries

Power production (1.X)
-----------------------

In all the power producing DLCs (1.X), the wind turbine should be running and connected to an electrical load.
According to the standard, deviations from theoretical operating conditions (like yaw misalignment0 should be considered).
``yaw_misalign`` is an available option for all these cases; the default is 0 deg. for all 1.X cases.
DLC 1.X simulations all use a normal turbulence model.  The class and type is set in the ``assembly`` options in the geometry input.
For DLCs 1.1--1.5, a normal sea state is used, based on the modeling options ``(DLC_driver,metocean_conditions,wave_height_NSS)``.
These wave heights correspond to the ``wind_speed`` input in the ``(DLC_driver,metocean_conditions))`` table.  
There is a similar option for ``wave_period_NSS``.


DLC 1.1
-------
Normal turbulence and sea state, specified using the options described above, with wind speeds spanning the operational wind speeds. 
Specific wind speeds can be selected with the ``(DLC_driver,DLCs,DLC: "1.1", wind_speed)`` input.
The default number of seeeds ``(DLC_driver,DLCs,DLC: "1.1", n_seeds)`` is 1, but more (6 or 12) are typically used to achieve convergence.

.. figure:: /images/dlcs/DLC11.png
   :align: center
   :width: 70%

In this demonstration we show a below rated (7 m/s, weis_job_02), near rated (11 m/s, weis_job_04), and above rated (17 m/s, weis_job_07) simulation.


DLC 1.2
-------

DLC 1.2 simulations are very similar to DLC 1.1 simulation.  More metocean combinations can be specified, along with their probabilities using the following options::

  DLC_driver:
    metocean_conditions:
        wind_speed: [1.,3.,5.,7.,9.,11.,13.,15.,17.,19.,21.,23.,25.,27.,29.]
        wave_height_fatigue: [0.84,0.84,0.87,0.99,1.15,1.34,1.58,1.82,2.08,2.34,2.66,2.98,3.28,3.77,3.94]
        wave_period_fatigue: [8.3,8.3,8.3,7.7,7.1,6.3,6.1,6.2,6.2,6.7,7.1,7.1,7.7,7.7,7.7]
        probabilities: [0.05,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.05,0.05]

Note that postprocessing using these probabilities is currently under construction, with an anticipated release in Q2 of 2025.


DLC 1.3
-------

DLC 1.3 is used for ultimate loading with the extreme turbulence model (ETM) and a normal sea state.
Note that the standard specifies some guidance for the scaling of this turbulence based on the extrapolation of DLC 1.1 results; this is not yet included in WEIS.

.. figure:: /images/dlcs/DLC13.png
   :align: center
   :width: 70%

Here, we compare a DLC 1.1 simulation with a DLC 1.3 simulation and note the differences in wind speed (Wind1VelX), control signals, and tower loading.

DLC 1.4
-------

DLC 1.4 models an extreme coherent gust with direction change (ECD) transient event that causes ultimate loading.
The WEIS DLC driver simulates this case across wind speeds, but the standard specifies that it only needs to be simulated near rated conditions.
At each wind speed, both a positive and negative change in direction will be simulated.
For each of those cases, users can specify the ``n_azimuth`` input to start the simulation at evenly spaced azimuthal positions from 0 to 120 deg. to ensure a full sampling of the blade loads when the gust occurs.

.. figure:: /images/dlcs/DLC14.png
   :align: center
   :width: 70%

DLC 1.5
-------
In thise case, we model an extreme wind shear (EWS) event.  Both positive and negative direciton shears are generated, along with horizontal and vertical shear.  

.. figure:: /images/dlcs/DLC15.png
   :align: center
   :width: 70%


DLC 1.6
-------

DLC 1.6 models a turbine operating in normal turbulence with a severe sea state.  The severe sea state is determined based on the ``metocean`` inputs of the DLC driver as follows::
    
    metocean_conditions:
      wind_speed: [1.,3.,5.,7.,9.,11.,13.,15.,17.,19.,21.,23.,25.,27.,29.]
      wave_height_SSS: [9.7,9.7,9.7,9.7,9.7,9.7,9.7,9.7,9.7,9.7,9.7,9.7,9.7,9.7,9.7]
      wave_period_SSS: [13.6,13.6,13.6,13.6,13.6,13.6,13.6,13.6,13.6,13.6,13.6,13.6,13.6,13.6,13.6]

Note that ``wind_speed`` in the ``metocean_conditions`` table is shared with the ``NSS`` inputs to the table.

.. figure:: /images/dlcs/DLC16.png
   :align: center
   :width: 70%

Here, we compare a DLC 1.1 simulation with a DLC 1.6 and the extreme waves modeled in that case.


Power production with fault (2.X)
---------------------------------
DLCs 2.X involves cases where faults turbine and/or loss of electrical network connection occurs while the turbine is producing power and connected to an electircal load.
In additions to the options used to describe power production, DLC 2.X allow foroptions to descibe blade pitch, generator and yaw faults.
The azimuth position for the rotor at the time of a fault may have significant influence on the load levels.
Therefore, the `azimuth_init` is required for DLC 2.X.

DLC 2.1 
-------
DLC 2.1 related to normal control system fault or loss of electrical network.
The faults included in this DLC are: blade pitch fault, yaw position fault and, loss of electrical network.
What is a pitch 
'pitchfault_time1','pitchfault_blade1pos'
This DLC is evaulated for normal sea-state and normal turbulence model.
The partial safety factor for this DLC is assumed to be 1.35.
The azimuth position at time of occurrence of the fault is randomly selected.


.. DLC 2.2
.. """""""
.. Some genfault in 2.1 should be moved to 2.2, needs discussion

------------------------------------
Setting Up DLCs (for developers)
------------------------------------

In the dlc_generator class (``/weis/dlc_driver/dlc_generator.py``), you can add new functions for additional DLCs.
Several examples are already there, like ``generate_2p3()``.  New functions should follow the ``generate_*`` naming convention.  Note that ``.`` is automatically mapped to ``p``.

The function should start with some helpful comments::

  # Power production normal turbulence model - normal sea state

The ``dlc_options`` dictionary contains inputs for that particular DLC in the modeling options.  Default options include some modeling options common across DLCs.::

  # Get default options
  dlc_options.update(self.default_options)   

Next, options specific to that DLC hard-coded in the function.  Error checking may be helpful here, too::
  
  # Handle DLC Specific options:
  dlc_options['label'] = '1.1'
  dlc_options['sea_state'] = 'normal'
  dlc_options['PSF'] = 1.35

  # Set yaw_misalign, else default
  if 'yaw_misalign' in dlc_options:
      dlc_options['yaw_misalign'] = dlc_options['yaw_misalign']
  else: # default
      dlc_options['yaw_misalign'] = [0]

Now, the special part happens, where we define groups of variables that are grouped and the cases are a cartesian product of the groups.
For example in this DLC 1.1 example::

  # DLC-specific: define groups
  # These options should be the same length and we will generate a matrix of all cases
  generic_case_inputs = []
  generic_case_inputs.append(['total_time','transient_time'])  # group 0, (usually constants) turbine variables, DT, aero_modeling
  generic_case_inputs.append(['wind_speed','wave_height','wave_period', 'wind_seed','wave_seed']) # group 1, initial conditions will be added here, define some method that maps wind speed to ICs and add those variables to this group
  generic_case_inputs.append(['yaw_misalign']) # group 2

The time and other constant options are in the first group.  This group usually has a length of one.
Wind speed, wave height, wave period, and the seeds are varied together in the second group.  
For example the wind speed may be 8, 10, and 12, and the corresponding wave height/period will vary with the wind speed. 
Initial conditions are automatically applied in this group via linear interpolation.  Search for the ``initial_condition_table`` dictionary.
The wind speed and other metocean conditions are added to the dlc_options automatically.  
The developer only needs to provide specific values in certain cases, like DLC 6.1.
If the user also wants to vary the yaw_misalign, those offsets will be applied on each wind speed.

Finally, the ``generate_cases`` method will do the rest of the work and (hopefully) check for errors along the way::

  self.generate_cases(generic_case_inputs,dlc_options)

Any options you want to vary across should be added to the ``dlc_options`` dictionary.
