Geometry Inputs
******************************
Significant effort has been invested to develop an **ontology** for wind turbines systems analysis by the IEA Wind Task 37 - Systems Engineering in its `WindIO <https://github.com/IEAWindTask37/windIO>`_ project.  WISDEM and WEIS uses this ontology for the physical description of the turbine, and its components, and the required level of fidelity for systems analysis.

Full documentation of the WEIS geometry input file can be found at the `WindIO documentation <https://windio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/turbine.html>`_

Specific implementation of WindIO within WEIS is explained below.
