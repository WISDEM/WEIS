## Usage

0. Run DFSM and genrate an initial set of openfast _inputs_ to pre-determine cases; ``../09_DFSM/dfsm_sim_driver.py`` works for this. Running SeaState with WaveMod 5 so will ensure that the same wave elevation is used for both.

1. Run 1_save_winddataset.py; it runs OpenFAST simulations and saves rotor average wind speeds, so both fidelities use the same wind/wave inputs.

2. Run 2_run_comparison.py: it compares the outputs between both simulation types.  Check ``plot_comp/`` folder in OpenFAST output directory

3. Run 3_run_multifidelity.py to do MF optimization.

## Developer Notes

 - Wave files are generated in dfsm_wrapper
 - ``mf_controls.py`` will set up openfast runs
