This example is a good starting point to simulate land-based wind turbines. It runs the IEA 3.4 MW reference wind turbine, which is described at https://github.com/IEAWindTask37/IEA-3.4-130-RWT, for a list of relevant design load cases, which are specified in the modeling options. When starting from this example, users should increase the time duration of the design load cases. The `analysis_time` is currently set to a few seconds (5-20) as this example is part of GitHub Actions and is continuously run in the background. `transient_time` should also be increased to 60 or 120 seconds. The data from these first seconds is discarded.

Note that this example runs a single function call of WEIS Level 3 (OpenFAST), and does not run any optimization. The analysis_options.yaml file is empty except for specifying the path to the output folder and the base name for the output files.
