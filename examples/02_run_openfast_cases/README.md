These examples run an OpenFAST model that has not been generated by WISDEM; it can be used to run OpenFAST DLC cases and optimize the ROSCO controller.

To select the OpenFAST model, point to the [`openfast_dir`](https://github.com/WISDEM/WEIS/blob/02094aeffcd5d35415a4e1b2569f714f29767d25/examples/02_control_opt/modeling_options.yaml#L32) and `openfast_file`.  The key input that bypasses the WISDEM-generated OpenFAST model is [`from_openfast`](https://github.com/WISDEM/WEIS/blob/02094aeffcd5d35415a4e1b2569f714f29767d25/examples/02_control_opt/modeling_options.yaml#L30) = `true`.

There are 3 examples in this directory

1. `weis_driver_loads.py` runs a DLC analysis, without optimization.
2. `weis_driver_rosco_opt.py` runs a control optimization.
3. `weis_driver_sm.py` runs a controller optimization that accounts for the robust stability margin.


[More information about setting DLCs can be found here](https://github.com/WISDEM/WEIS/blob/docs/docs/dlc_generator.rst)

The only geometry inputs that need to be specified in this example are in the `assembly` and `environment` sections.  


To run these examples, please make sure you are in your WEIS conda environment and run

```
python weis_driver.py
```

or the appropriate `weis_driver<script>.py`
