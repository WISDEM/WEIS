This example runs several IEA-15MW RWT cases.  We could bring the RAFT cases in here.

Geometry options
- IEA fixed bottom
- IEA VolturnUS
- IEA VolturnUS with TMDs (this one is special and would ideally inheret the previous)

Modeling options

Analysis options

<!-- `weis_driver.py` runs an analysis (not optimization) of the monopile version of the IEA 15MW. -->
<!-- `weis_driver_umaine_semi.py` performs an optimization of the IEA 15MW equipped with the UMaine VolturnUS-S floating platform. -->
<!-- `weis_driver_TMDs.py` performs an optimization of the tuned mass damper (TMD) properties for the floating platform version of IEA 15MW. -->
<!-- `weis_driver_tower_DVs.py` performs a tower sizing optimization of the floating platform version of IEA 15MW with TMDs included. -->
