**These examples are currently under construction: FloatingSE does not technically support multiple variable ballasts, so the resulting models may be unpredictable.**


To run these examples, please make sure you are in your WEIS conda environment and run

```
python weis_driver.py
```

or the appropriate `weis_driver<script>.py`
