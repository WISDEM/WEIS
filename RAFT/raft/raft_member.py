# RAFT's support structure member class

## This class represents linear (for now cylindrical and rectangular) components in the substructure.
#  It is meant to correspond to Member objects in the WEIS substructure ontology, but containing only
#  the properties relevant for the Level 1 frequency-domain model, as well as additional data strucutres
#  used during the model's operation.
