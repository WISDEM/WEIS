About MoorPy
-------------

MoorPy is a simple, efficient, and versatile mooring system quasi-static model designed to work 
in concert with other simulation tools. It is based on a catenary line model and it
adds point-mass and rigid-body objects to enable simulation of a 
wide variety of mooring and cabling arrangements.

The MoorPy source code is available on GitHub `here <https://github.com/NREL/MoorPy>`_.
