Overview
========

MAP++ has its own `documentation <https://map-plus-plus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ that describes the theory, applications, and approach in depth.  The standalone MAP++ codebase can more or less be considered deprecated.  Active development is taking place in the other repositories that have included MAP++, namely this one and `OpenFAST <https://github.com/OpenFAST/openfast>`_.

This Python wrapper includes a chiefly modifications to the standard code to eliminate all input/output files in favor of direct variable passing.

Tutorial

Examples that show how to use the Python API to MAP++ are provided in the standalone `pyMAP repository <https://github.com/WISDEM/pyMAP/tree/master/test>`_.
