First Steps in WISDEM
---------------------

WISDEM just needs three input files for many optimization and analysis operations. These files specify the geometry of the turbine, modeling options, and analysis options. The files and details about them are outlined in the following table:

+---------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Description               | Suggested Default to Modify                                                                                                     | Where to learn more                                                          |
+===========================+=================================================================================================================================+==============================================================================+
| Geometry of the turbine   | `nrel5mw.yaml <https://github.com/WISDEM/WISDEM/blob/develop/examples/reference_turbines_lcoe/nrel5mw.yaml>`_                   | `WindIO docs <https://windio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/turbine.html>`_ |
+---------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Modeling options          | `modeling_options.yaml <https://github.com/WISDEM/WISDEM/blob/develop/examples/reference_turbines_lcoe/modeling_options.yaml>`_ | TODO: Add docs here                                                          |
+---------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+---------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

There are two options to run WISDEM with these files. The first option is to use a text editor to modify files and to run WISDEM from the command line. The second option is to edit the files with a GUI and run WISDEM with the click of a button. This document will describe both of these options in turn.

The first step for either option is to make copies of example files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Before you start editing your WISDEM input files, please make copies of the original files in a separate folder. This ensures that, if you edit copies of the original files, you can always revert back to a version of the files that is known to execute successfully.

Option 1: Text editor and command line
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
First, edit the files in the text editor. You can use the ontology guide as a reference when you create the geometry file. Edit the geometry, modeling options, and analysis options as you need them:

.. figure:: /images/yaml/text_editor_01.png

Second, after you are done editing, run WISDEM from the command line with a command of the following form:

::

    conda activate wisdem-env
    wisdem [geometry file].yaml [modeling file].yaml [analysis file].yaml

Substitute ``[geometry file].yaml`` with the filename for your geometry, ``[modeling file].yaml`` with your modeling filename and ``[analysis file].yaml`` with your analysis filename. If you were to run WISDEM with the example files provided above, the command would be ``wisdem nrel5mw.yaml modeling_options.yaml analysis_options.yaml``

WISDEM will produce output messages as it runs. At the end, if everything executes correctly, you will see output similar to the following:

::

    Objectives
    Turbine AEP: 24.7350498151 GWh
    Blade Mass:  16403.6823269407 kg
    LCOE:        48.8313243406 USD/MWh
    Tip Defl.:   4.1150829328 m

A command line session to execute WISDEM in this way will look similar to the following figure. This will vary depending on your installation, but the basic elements should be there. Note the final lines that WISDEM outputs, as shown above:

.. figure:: /images/yaml/wisdem_cli_step_01.png

Outputs from the run are stored in the ``outputs`` folder that is created within the folder in which you executed the WISDEM command. These are described in detail in the outputs section of this document.

Option 2: WISDEM GUI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Launching the GUI is simpler than launching the command line. Activate you environment and execute the WISDEM GUI with the following commands:

::

    conda activate wisdem-env
    wisdem

The WISDEM GUI is laid out from left to right to edit the geometry, modeling, and analysis files. The upper part of the interface shows a status bar and at the right side there is a `Run WISDEM` button.

When you start the WISDEM GUI, a window similar to the following will appear, depending on whether you are running macOS or Windows:

.. figure:: /images/yaml/wisdem_gui_step_01.png
.. figure:: /images/yaml/windows_wisdem_gui_step_01.png

First, load a geometry file. The `nrel5mw.yaml` file is loaded in the following figure. Load this file by clicking the `Select geometry YAML` button and selecting your copy of `nrel5mw.yaml`.

.. figure:: /images/yaml/wisdem_gui_step_02.png
.. figure:: /images/yaml/windows_wisdem_gui_step_02.png

Similarly, open your copies of the `modeling_options.yaml` as in the following figure:

.. figure:: /images/yaml/wisdem_gui_step_03.png
.. figure:: /images/yaml/windows_wisdem_gui_step_03.png

Finally, open the `analysis_options.yaml` as seen in this figure:

.. figure:: /images/yaml/wisdem_gui_step_04.png
.. figure:: /images/yaml/windows_wisdem_gui_step_04.png

In the GUI, click on the `Run WISDEM` button. The following dialog box will appear

.. figure:: /images/yaml/wisdem_gui_step_05.png

When you see this dialog box, the GUI has written the YAML files. WISDEM may take a while to run, so you are asked to confirm that you want to execute the run of WISDEM. Click `OK` to continue. Once you click `OK`, the GUI will stop responding while WISDEM executes. Watch the command line window for messages as WISDEM executes. When WISDEM has finished, you will see the following message:

.. figure:: /images/yaml/wisdem_gui_step_06.png

Working with Outputs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In the outputs folder there are several files. Each of them hold all the output variables from a run but are in different formats for various environments:

+-----------+-------------------------+
| Extension | Description             |
+===========+=========================+
| ``.mat``  | MatLab output format    |
+-----------+-------------------------+
| ``.npz``  | Archive of NumPy arrays |
+-----------+-------------------------+
| ``.pkl``  | Python Pickle format    |
+-----------+-------------------------+
| ``.xlsx`` | Microsoft Excel format  |
+-----------+-------------------------+
| ``.yaml`` | YAML format             |
+-----------+-------------------------+

As an example, here is a script to plot Axial Induction versus Blade Nondimensional Span by extracting the values from the Python pickle file. Copy it into a text editor and save it to the same folder that you executed WISDEM from:

::

    import pickle
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    refturb_pickle = pickle.load(open("outputs/refturb_output.pkl", "rb"))
    refturb = {r[0]: r[1] for r in refturb_pickle}
    xs = refturb["wt.wt_init.blade.outer_shape_bem.compute_blade_outer_shape_bem.s_default"]["value"]
    ys = refturb["wt.sse.powercurve.compute_power_curve.ax_induct_regII"]["value"]
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=1, figsize=(10, 5))
    ax.plot(xs, ys)
    ax.set_xlabel("Blade Nondimensional Span [-]")
    ax.set_ylabel("Axial Induction [-]")
    plt.show()

This script generates the following plot:

.. figure:: /images/yaml/first_steps_first_plot.png
