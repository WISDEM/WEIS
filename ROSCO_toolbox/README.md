# NREL's Reference OpenSource Controller (ROSCO) toolbox for wind turbine applications
NREL's Reference OpenSource Controller (ROSCO) toolbox for wind turbine applications is a toolbox designed to ease controller implementation for the wind turbine researcher. Some primary capabilities include:
* Generic tuning of NREL's ROSCO controller
* Simple 1-DOF turbine simulations for quick controller capability verifications
* Parsing of OpenFAST input and output files


## Introduction
The NREL Reference OpenSource Controller (ROSCO) provides an open, modular and fully adaptable baseline wind turbine controller to the scientific community. The ROSCO toolbox leverages this architecture and implementation to provide a generic tuning process for the controller. Because of the open character and modular set-up, scientists are able to collaborate and contribute in making continuous improvements to the code for the controller and the toolbox. The ROSCO toolbox is a mostly-python code base with a number of functionalities.

## Documentation
All relevant documentation about the ROSCO toolbox and ROSCO controller can be found at through [ROSCO's readthedocs webpage](https://rosco-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Here, users can find the information on [installing the ROSCO toolbox](https://rosco-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/install.html#installing-the-rosco-toolbox) and [compiling ROSCO](https://rosco-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/install.html#compiling-rosco) for control purposes. Additionally, there is information on the standard workflow and uses cases for the ROSCO toolchain, and more.
