# NREL's Reference OpenSource Controller (ROSCO) for wind turbine applications
NREL's Reference OpenSource Controller (ROSCO) for wind turbine applications uses the Bladed-style DISCON interface used by OpenFAST, Bladed (versions 4.5 or earlier), HAWC2, and more.

## Introduction
The NREL Reference OpenSource Controller (ROSCO) provides an open, modular and fully adaptable baseline wind turbine controller to the scientific community. Because of the open character and modular set-up, scientists are able to collaborate and contribute in making continuous improvements to the code. New control implementations can be added to the existing baseline controller, and in this way, convenient assessments of the proposed algorithms is possible. ROSCO is being developed in Fortran and uses the Bladed-style DISCON controller interface. The compiled controller is configured by a single control settings parameter file, and can work with any wind turbine model and simulation software using the DISCON interface. Baseline parameter files are supplied for the NREL 5-MW, DTU 10-MW, and IEA15MW reference wind turbines.

## Documentation
Relevant documentation about the ROSCO controller and corresponding ROSCO toolbox can all be found at https://rosco-toolbox.readthedocs.io/. 

## Downloading/Compiling ROSCO
The easiest way to get the most recent version release of ROSCO is to download it from the [tagged releases](https://github.com/NREL/ROSCO/tags) page. If you wish to download ROSCO using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or compile ROSCO yourself, please follow the instruction [here](https://rosco-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/install.html#compiling-rosco). Compiling ROSCO will be necessary if you wish to use any version of ROSCO that is not a tagged release.

## Running ROSCO
A few files are needed to run ROSCO. Of course, the compiled binary, named `libdiscon.*` by default, is needed. This should be appropriately pointed to by your ServoDyn input file (for OpenFAST). In addition to the binary, a controller input file title DISCON.IN is necessary. Three example input files are provided for the NREL 5MW, DTU 10MW, and IEA 15MW wind turbine controllers in the [parameter_files](parameter_files) folder. Note that DISCON.IN (or similar) is pointed to by the `DLL_InFile` parameter in ServoDyn. For generic controller tuning methods, and an automated writing of this DISCON.IN file, we point you to the complete [ROSCO_toolbox](https://github.com/nrel/rosco_toolbox). 

In addition to DISCON.IN, if you wish to use either of the wind speed estimators (`WE_Mode > 0`) or pitch saturation routines (`PS_Mode > 0`) offered by ROSCO , you will need a rotor performance input file. This is, again, provided for the sample wind turbines, and can be easily made for other turbines using the [ROSCO_toolbox](https://github.com/nrel/rosco_toolbox). The input `PerfFileName` in DISCON.IN points to this file. 

## Using ROSCO for Bladed
If you want to use the controller with DNV GL Bladed v4.5 or earlier (which still has support for the DISCON external controller interface), do the following:
1. Be sure to use and place the 32-bit DLL in the same folder as where you put your project .$PJ-file
2. Copy in that same folder the DISCON.IN controller configuration file
3. Set-up the 32-bit DLL as an external controller (Control -> Discrete External Controller -> Define...)
3. Open the DISCON.IN file with a text editor and copy its entire contents in the "External controller data:" section (Control -> Discrete External Controller -> Define...)
4. Run a "Power Production" simulation

The Delft Research Controller was the initial version of this work. It has since been grown significantly and become NREL's ROSCO. 

Primary contributions to ROSCO have been provided by researchers the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (Nikhar J. Abbas, Daniel Zalkind, Alan Wright, and Paul Fleming), Delft University of Technology (Sebastiaan Mulders and Jan-Willem van Wingerden), and the University of Colorado Boulder (Lucy Pao).
